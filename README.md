# Jigsaw Tiles
Jigsaw tiles is a variant of the classic jigsaw puzzle.

Jigsaw Tiles takes an image, divides it into a set of similar tiles
(it "tessalates" the image) then shuffles the tiles. Your challenge is
to unscramble the image by swapping tiles.

Jigsaw Tiles require [Tcl/Tk](https://www.tcl-lang.org/software/tcltk/9.0.html) to run.

## Wikipedia Picture of the Day
You can choose any picture on you computer to turn into a puzzle. Or more
conveniently, you can have Jigsaw Tiles select a random picture from
Wikipedia's or Wiki Common's archive of Picture of the Day images. It will
automatically download and scale the image for you.

## Tessalations
By default Jigsaw Tiles can divide your image into rectangles, squares, "L"
or "S" shapes. If you have [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
installed, then more shapes are available, such as hexagons, octagons and trapezoids.

## Expert Puzzle Mode
Export Puzzle mode provides an additional challenge. It randomly selects three tiles
and pixelates them, obscuring their contents making it harder to determine where they
belong.

## License
The software is release under the MIT License.
